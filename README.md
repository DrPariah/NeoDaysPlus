# NeoDaysPlus
Reduced contrast, expanded, and continuously developed version of the CDDA tileset NeoDays that's being completed with mostly reused NeoDays references if they makes sense, otherwise creating new sprites for missing items.

## Differences to the OG NeoDays
Reduced contrast for terrain and floor tiles. Some bright colours have been muted slightly.

Grass has been pruned to only one tuft of grass that slightly changes position via autotiling

Shallow water/deep water/sewage/slime have an autotile that includes a border for clearer differentiation of terrain while giving a border for bodies of water

Reduced dots on road tiles for reduced visual noise

Sidewalk uses new tile based on NeoDays' cement tile for reduced visual noise (especially when beside road tiles)

Removed light-blue open air tile for light-sensitivity.

### Additional Differences
- Reduction of vanilla ascii fallbacks
  - Several dozen fallback items/mobs have been reassigned to either OG NeoDays tiles that fit, or freshly created ones (located in `plus.png`)

### Mod support (literally no priority)
**Currently working through Vanilla**
- Beginning Magiclysm coverage in v2.0.0
