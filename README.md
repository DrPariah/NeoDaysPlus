# NeoDaysPlus
Expanded and continuously developed version of the CDDA tileset NeoDays that's being completed with mostly reused NeoDays references if they makes sense, otherwise creating new sprites for missing items.

[Credit for anything not 100% mine goes to the original NeoDays tileset](https://github.com/I-am-Erk/CDDA-Tilesets)

## Differences to the OG NeoDays
- Terrain autotiling that still retains the "NeoDays feel" but smoothing out some noise (still in development)
- Removed light-blue open air tile for light-sensitivity.
- Reduction of vanilla ascii fallbacks

## TODO:
Currently these items are using reused references and if things get too confusing, will revisit these lesser TODOs
